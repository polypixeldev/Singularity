		***My Singularity is the new best way to show off what you've done for a server!***

		**What is "My Singularity"?**
		My Singularity is the feature of this bot that allows you to show off in a whole new way. \
		Instead of just plain leveling, rank cards, and leaderboards, My Singularity allows you to, hence the name, build *YOUR OWN* black hole!

		**How does it work?**
		By being active in a server, you can gain *protons* and *electrons*. These protons and electrons are a sort of currency in the My Singularity system. \
		You can use them to make your black hole bigger, or to trade them in for better items. The Developers (poly#3622 and Redstone#1165) will always be adding new features to My Singularity to keep your black hole growing!

		*Use \`${serverDoc.prefix}help ms\` to get a full list of My Singularity commands*
